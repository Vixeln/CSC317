      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Vireak, or just V. I am an international student from
        Cambodia pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in
        Mathematics. I am very interested in Computer Graphics and 3D Rendering,
        I love learning about the clever algorithms in rendering as well as the
        advanced Mathematics used in those algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I aspire to study abroad in Germany one day, perhaps even pursure a
        Master's there and do research Computer Graphics. I really want to
        experience Europe for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of university, I volunteer in high school classrooms as a tutor.
        I love teaching Math and Physics. I want to share my passion and
        interest to other students and be a source of inspiration for students.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like learning languages. After I am proficient in German, I
        would love to maybe learn Spanish or Japanese. One of the reasons that I
        wanted to learn these languages is becuase I enjoy listening to music in
        these languages. I like music and I want to be able to play the guitar
        and write my own songs one day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like art. I used to do pixel art back when I played Minecraft a
        lot and wanted to modify the game with addons. Nowadays I want to get
        into digital art and learn to express complex emotions in my art pieces.
      </p>

        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
        <p>
          Vixite, a lazy play of words for V's Website, was my beginner project
          to learn the VueJS framework during the Winter break in January 2025.
          The website is suppose to serve as project navigator to display all of
          my past projects. Because a lot of my past projects were on Desmos, I
          wanted to build a wrapper to showcase my Desmos projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project has taught me . After using it for a few weeks, I have
          grown to like their Single File Component philosophy a lot.

        <h3>Infinite Scroll Component</h3>
        <p>
          The infinite scroll component is intended to be used as a container to
          display multiple avatars/profile icons and give off the effect that
          the list is endless. This was my beginner project to ReactJS that I
          wanted to do before I started working on SF Hacks website. I learned a
          lot about React and React's Escape Hatches, how to directly modify the
          DOM, how to use UseEffect(), images and CSS background images, etc.

        <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
        <p>
          This website was a very simple portfolio website that I had to set up
          for one of my classes. The site showcases my skills, programming languages, 
					and past projects.

### Ethan Garcia - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
There were two routes that ChatGPT generated; one way was to have the font “Digital-7” externally downloaded on my laptop. That was my first attempt at using AI to create a CSS file. I then asked the chatbot to give me familiar fonts to avoid needing to have an external download of the digital 7 font. It recommended me use Obitron. I discarded the first attempt’s CSS since I 1) did not test it and 2) forgot to feed the chatbot Vireak’s HTML code, so it did not know any of the semantics or elements of the HTML code that we want the CSS file for. In a new chat that was sandboxed away from this first chat, I asked ChatGPT the prompt that I had pushed into the repository. Luckily, the CSS had no problems working with Vireak’s HTML file. It used a URL to implement the font. Regarding the hybrid, Bahara and I chose to mix our CSS files. I liked her layout, so we decided to keep her layout. From my CSS file, I wanted to implement the color scheme (black and red) and the rhombus crop on Vireak’s portrait. The crop didn’t end up looking well, so we kept it simple by having a circle crop for the portrait.

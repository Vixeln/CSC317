# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
For the manual CSS file, we decided to have Vireak and Luis collaborate because Vireak has a lot of experience with vanilla CSS and it would be a great opportunity for Luis to learn some advanced CSS. If anything bad happens to the handwritten CSS, Vireak would be able to quickly identify and fix the bug. The plan was to have Luis do the initial styles like the layout, color schemes, and animation; then have Vireak come in to patch up any oversights and clean up the code.

For the AI-1 CSS file, Ethan made two ChatGPT instances so one could not influence the other < and vice versa>. The first chat instance had come up with a CSS file that required an external download to implement a font style. To avoid any possible issues in the submission process, Ethan decided to ask the same chat instance for a font that did not require an external download. The Obitron font was the substitute that was suggested. Now that the problem has been straightened out, Ethan created the last ChatGPT instance with a better prompt, and the AI-1 CSS that was submitted was the outcome of that instance.

For the AI-2.css file, Bahara used both chatGpt and Claude. Both chatBots fail to grasp the full idea at the start but with more explanations they got pretty close to the desired style, still cis not get it completly. The easiest thing though is to add some parts manually. Especially when it comes to sizing or grids the more you explain and specify it the more the chatBot gets confused. That is why Bahara suggests that after a certain point it is just easier to do it manually and if more changes are needed you can go back to AI and ask for other styles. 

For the AI-3 CSS file, Vireak used ChatGPT to generate a stylesheet to make the website feel nostalgic and old school. The first attempt was pretty short as he realized he needed to write a more concise description of what he wanted ChatGPT to do(And not to do). So for the 2nd attempt, he gave it a very dense and long description of his ideal CSS and then asked it to add small tweaks to the file until it looked good. During this 2nd attempt, he noticed a lot of issues with how it generated the file and had to tell it to fix its own bugs. But after a dozen prompts, he was satisfied with the result and incorporated it to his ai stylesheet.

For the AI-4 CSS file, Luis used Gemini Pro to come up with three different instances, eventually committing to the third conversation, with a strategy in which small adjustments and idea prompts were fed to the AI in order to eventually come up with an entire CSS file. For context, the first two conversations were quite short, as he realized quickly that having one gigantic prompt was just simply too much for the AI to handle. So breaking up that prompt into much smaller, more concise prompts ended up being what is now the final version.

For the Hybrid version, Bahara and Ethan worked together. First they showed a version of their AI code to each other and talked about their experience of working with AI. After they combined some parts of the versions they worked on and came up with a hybrid style. A big portion of the hybrid style was copied from the AI version, a little was written by the members. Based on their experience, it is good to let AI do most of the parts, especially those that are repetitive like buttons. It just saves so much time for everyone. Also, there can be challenges when different people are working together on a file and it is good to have colors and themes specified so there is a solid foundation when a group is working together. 


## Individual Reflections

### Vireak Ny - Hand-written CSS (Part 1)
While making the AI stylesheet, it was quite convenient for ChatGPT to generate the base styles as it saved me a lot of setup time. However, I realized that I still had to analyze the CSS myself to try to understand why certain styles were breaking so that I can instruct the AI to fix the correct error. 

As for working with Luis on the manual stylesheet, I was helping him learn CSS animations, transitions,flexboxes and grids. A difficulty I had with that was communication and terminologies. We actually just drew a wireframe of the website on a piece of paper so that both of us were on the same track.

### Luis Buenavista - Hand-written CSS (Part 2)
I was mainly responsible for planning the layout and look of the webpage itself, as well as working on the Skills and Project section. I found writing in hand-written CSS to be challenging, but a lot of fun. The whole process mainly consisted of coming up with ideas, and looking through documentation in order to put those ideas on the page. Vireak was a big help in providing me the right resources and walking me through how to do things. Regarding my AI-generated CSS, I used Gemini Pro. This process at first was quite frustrating, as I just could not come up with the right prompts to get where I wanted to. Eventually, after the third conversation, I was able to find a strategy in which I prompted small adjustments to the CSS until I got what I wanted, as opposed to asking for a full CSS all at once. It was really interesting seeing the slow progression of what the page would eventually end up becoming. The main idea behind how I wanted it to look was similar to Apple’s website and the minimalist, clean look, while adding some animation to make it a little more interesting.

### Bahara Mehry - AI Text Prompt CSS
When I was working with the AI version, I noticed that AI can not give you what you describe. It can be for 2 reasons, one because you were not able to describe it properly and completely and second it is just impossible for AI to know what exactly your version is. Also, as you build up on your prompt and ask AI to change its original answer multiple times, it gets further away from giving the right answer. When that happens I just start a new chat and give it a new prompt that is a combination of the first prompt and all the descriptions I gave the chat bot later. Since we were not allowed to make any modification on the code produced by AI, I had to keep what it gave or give more prompts, but if that was not the requirement, it is easier to bring those changes manually. 

### Ethan Garcia - AI Image+Text Prompt CSS (if applicable)
There were two routes that ChatGPT generated; one way was to have the font “Digital-7” externally downloaded on my laptop. That was my first attempt at using AI to create a CSS file. I then asked the chatbot to give me familiar fonts to avoid needing to have an external download of the digital 7 font. It recommended me use Obitron. I discarded the first attempt’s CSS since I 1) did not test it and 2) forgot to feed the chatbot Vireak’s HTML code, so it did not know any of the semantics or elements of the HTML code that we want the CSS file for. In a new chat that was sandboxed away from this first chat, I asked ChatGPT the prompt that I had pushed into the repository. Luckily, the CSS had no problems working with Vireak’s HTML file. It used a URL to implement the font. Regarding the hybrid, Bahara and I chose to mix our CSS files. I liked her layout, so we decided to keep her layout. From my CSS file, I wanted to implement the color scheme (black and red) and the rhombus crop on Vireak’s portrait. The crop didn’t end up looking well, so we kept it simple by having a circle crop for the portrait. 

## Group Preferred Version
They are all unique in their own way and we think that AI1 and AI2 contain more features and visually look more appealing. However, we acknowledge the work that has been put in writing the manual css file. It is a pretty solid and clean work and we appreciate the time and effort that has been put in it. Overall, the whole team did a really good job but there is a lot that can be improved and we hope to achieve it by practice and time. 

## Collaboration Experience
- We had great communication through our Discord group chat, but the implementation of branches and pull requests confused me. I appreciate my group’s efforts and support throughout the project. (Ethan)
- I found working with everyone quite streamlined. We knew what our roles were and what work we needed to do (Luis) 
- My teammates were very awesome and responsive, they were very patient with me even though I took a long time to set up the assignment folder for this project. I also had a lot of fun helping Luis learn CSS, but it was hard to find a long stretch of time for us to work together. (Vireak)
- At the beginning it was confusing how to work on the project together but once we had the branches things went super clear. I appreciate my team's communication and dedication. We got the time to talk in person, every one picked a role and we were constantly working on our parts. I also appreciate that every one was super helpful and was there to answer questions whenever someone had one. (Bahara)

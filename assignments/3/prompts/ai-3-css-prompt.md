With the provided html file, generate me a CSS file that makes my profile picture look like it was taken with a Kodak Ultra max film roll. The color scheme of the whole page should feel nostalgic as if form the 1970s and compliment with the profile picture. The website should be laid out such that the <aside> element is always visible to the side because it is the table of contents DO NOT CHANGE the styling of the theme switcher, that is handled by a separate file and should not be touched

I want my profile picture to not have the gold colored border. Also make the profile picture look more film like and add some graininess to it using a png.

I want you to generate that grain png. also I have to put my images in an images folder. My CSS file will be put in a styles folder which is a sibling to the images folder.

Yes, generate that CSS file. While you're at it, also reuse that same grain png to add some subtle texture to backgrounds. But it shouldn't be as noticeable as the profile picture grain

The grain isn't working on the profile picture. Also the grain is still too strong on the background. Just use another grainy png that's a lot more subtle than the one for the profile picture

yes generate me that css file

Never mind, just don't use the grain.png anymore, the grain is affecting elements outside of the <img>. Just use the same subtle-grain.png for any grain, including the image. Also add a bit more grain to the subtle grain. Make the image for filmy by making the filters a bit stronger.

Add more sepia to the image. Increase the subtle-grain more again. Make the font color a bit lighter so it's softer relative to the background color

I don't know what you're doing with the layout, but the header has 0 height now, fix that. you don't have to make the grouping grids stuff grids. Also make the aside bar sticky to the top.

Don't use a fixed height for the header, that still broke the header and is just terrible. The height of the header should adapt to the heights of its elements. Also the sticky sidebar breaks because the height of the body isn't actually enough to fit the grid content. Fix the css

Can you lower the contrast and brightness, and increase the sepia
